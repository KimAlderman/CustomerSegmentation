# CustomerSegmentation

Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree project: creating customer segments

This was a unsupervised machine learning project in my Machine Learning Nanodegree at Udacity. Note that he dataset for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). Tools and techniques used in this project include:

* data exploration through summary statistics and data visualization, including heatmaps
* discovering feature correlations and distributions to identify relevant features
* performed feature scaling using a natural logarithmic transformation
* utilized Tukey's method of identifying outliers
* conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the dimensions which best maximizes variance
* used a PCA transformation to achieve dimensionality reduction
* splitting data into train & test sets, shuffling, and cross-validation
* numpy, pandas, sklearn, render, and seaborn libraries for Python
* implemented K-means clustering model
* real-life applicability discussion, including A/B testing on clusters and training a logistic regressor to predict cluster for new customers

This was one of my favorite projects. I was particularly proud of my review feedback.

>Perfect submission! :trophy:

>You have beautifully implemented most of the suggestions from the previous reviews, even those which were not obligatory! So there was not much to add in terms of comments.

>Good luck for the next project! :thumbsup:
